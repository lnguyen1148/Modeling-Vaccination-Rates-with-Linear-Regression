# Modeling-Vaccination-Rates-with-Linear-Regression

# Linh Nguyen

# COVID vaccination rates vary a great deal between countries. There are several reasons, including access to healthcare and demographics (countries prioritize recipients by age). The goal of this project is to use linear regression to model the vaccination rates in different countries in terms of their number of hospital beds per capita (a measure of access to healthcare) and demographics.
